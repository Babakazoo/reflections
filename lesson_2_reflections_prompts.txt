How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

Staging area is the part of repository - only files will be tracking. Working directory also has many real files, 
but staging area is an abstraction that has only tracked files.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

git diff --staged shows us which file changed but not yet in commit. Also we will see all changes in file
that we do not commit yet.


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

In adding experimental functions, or adding translations without touching the master branch. We may also combine 
branches.


How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
We see all brances and whole commit structure.
