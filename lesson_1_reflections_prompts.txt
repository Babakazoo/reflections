What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, 
like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Gogle Docs 
	- very often; not logical part of job; not full control of files; not offline commit;
	+ will not lose any changes
Git
	- may to forget to commit; each time have to decide by myself when to commit;
	+ commit only when i need it; offline, local; better track difference between two commits; add comments to commit;
	

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, 
while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Google Docs usually have deal with separate files, such as chapters of novel or separate notes. While Git 
designed for programmers, who work with many related files, which have related dependencies.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

Log allows us to see the time and ID of each commit. Diff allows to see the file changes in the commit and to see strings
which was deleted and added.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

We always may to return to any previous version of our code. And using history (git log) downgrade to any old commit.


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to try begin new android project using git :)
